AI has developed many tools for solving computer science's most difficult problems. Below are some of the most general approaches.
<h2>Search and optimization:</h2>
Many problems can potentially be resolved in AI through the intelligent quest for several potential solutions. For instance, logical evidence may be seen as a way of finding a way to draw conclusions from premises where each step is to apply an inference rule. Planning algorithms seek through trees of aims and goals, trying to find a way to a goal, called a mechanical analysis process. Robotics algorithms are used in configuration space for moving limbs and grabbing objects. Search algorithms based on optimization are used by many learning algorithms.
For the most real-world problems, easy and thorough searches are rarely enough. Astronomical numbers rise quickly in the search room. The result is a slow or unfulfilled search. For many problems, the solution is to use 'heuristics' or 'thumb rules' to prioritise decisions to those that are more likely to achieve a target and that in a lesser number of steps. Heuristics may also absolutely remove any options that are unlikely to lead to a target in some quest methodologies. Heuristics offers the software a "best guess" of the direction Heuristics will take in order to find solutions in a smaller sample. 
In the 1990s there was a very different search based on mathematical optimisation theory. For many problems, you can start the quest by making some guess and slowly refine the guess until you do not make any more improvements. We can imagine such algorithms as a blind hill climbing: at one point on the landscape, we begin looking, then we proceed to move upwards with jumps or moves, until we reach the top. Annealing, beam search and random optimization are further optimization algorithms.
<h3>Logic:</h3>
Logic is used for representing knowledge and solving problems, but it can also be used for other issues. For example, the satplan algorithm uses planning logic as well as inductive logic programming.
AI work uses different types of logic. Proposal logic includes "or" and "not" functions of truth. The first order logic adds quantifiers and predicates and can give expression to information concerning objects, their properties and their relationships. Fuzzy set theory confers on "the truth level" (between 0 and 1) a vague, too linguistically unprecision to be totally true or false statements like "Alice is old" or "rich, tall, hungry." "Alice is old."
