Any intellectual activity is important to AI. New techniques of artificial intelligence are far too common and too numerous. When a technique is commonly used, artificial intelligence is often no longer known as such; this phenomenon is called the AI effect.
High-profile examples of AI include autonomous vehicles Such as Drones and Self Driving Cars and search engines (such as Google search)

<h2>Healthcare:</h2>
AI in the area of health care is also used to facilitate an initial assessment of a CT or EKG or to classify high-risk public health patients. The variety of applications is increasing rapidly. As an example, AI is used to tackle the high-cost dose issue, where findings suggest that AI can save 16 billion dollars. In 2016, a groundbreaking study in California found that the exact dose of immunosuppressive drugs to give organ patients was correctly determined by a mathematical formula developed using AI.
Artificial intelligence is assisting doctors. According to Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft has developed AI to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer.
