Intelligence is embodied in computers as opposed to the natural intelligence exhibited by humans and animals by artificial intelligence ( AI), also called machine intelligence. Lead AI textbooks describe the field as a "smart agent" study: any system that sees its environment and takes actions in order to increase its probability of achieving its objectives successfully. The term "artificial intelligence" often serves as a colloquium description of machines (or computers) that imitate "cognitive" functions associated to the mind , for example, "learning" and "disordering problems."
As machines are increasingly capable, 'intelligence' tasks are often removed from the AI definition, a phenomenon called the AI effect. An anthology of the Tesler theorem states, "AI is something not achieved yet." For example, the detection of optical characteristics is sometimes omitted, as it is a commonplace technology, from the things called AI. Modern computer technologies commonly known as AI include the comprehension of human voice, competition at the highest level of strategy game systems, autonomous vehicles, intelligent content distribution network routing, and military simulations.
Founded in 1955 as a science, artificial intelligence, followed by failure and lack of investment, followed over the years by a wave of excitement and new methods and new funding. In the years after the latter was a wave of excitement. AI work has been divided into subfields for the most part of its history, which often do not interact.These subfields are based on technological criteria (for example, the application of different techniques ("logical" or artificial neural networks), or profound philosophical differences) (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning." Sub-fields are often focused on social factors (specific organizations or researchers' work).
It was believed that human intelligence could "be represented so accurately that it could be replicated by a computer." This raises philosophical arguments about the nature of mind and the ethic of man-made artificial beings. Myth, fiction and philosophy have been investigating these issues since ancient times. Some think that AI is a threat to humanity because it is constant. Others believe that AI will create the risk of mass unemployment, unlike previous technological revolutions.
AI technologies have flourished during the 21st century following parallel advances in computers , data volumes and theoretical understanding and AI technology has become an important component in the technology sector, helping to address a vast range of problems in computing, software engineering and operations science.
Informatics defines AI research as the study of "smart agents:"any device that perceives its environment and acts to maximise the chance of achieving its objectives successfully. A more elaborate definition defines AI as "the ability of the system to correctly interpret outside data, learn from such data and use them for specific purposes and tasks by flexible adaptation."

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reactive machines</td>
    <td>Reactive machines are the most basic type of AI system. This means that they cannot form memories or use past experiences to influence present-made decisions; they can only react to currently existing situations – hence “reactive.”</td>
    <td>Deep Blue, a chess-playing supercomputer created by IBM in the mid-1980s.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Limited memory</td>
    <td>Limited memory is comprised of machine learning models that derive knowledge from previously-learned information, stored data, or events. Unlike reactive machines, limited memory learns from the past by observing actions or data fed to them in order to build experiential knowledge.</td>
    <td>Autonomous vehicles, or self-driving cars</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Theory of mind</td>
    <td>What constitutes theory of mind is decision-making ability equal to the extent of a human mind, but by machines.</td>
    <td>voice assistants</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Self-awareness</td>
    <td>Self-aware AI involves machines that have human-level consciousness. This form of AI is not currently in existence, but would be considered the most advanced form of artificial intelligence known to man. </td>
